# IMPORTANT
This notebook is to demonstrate how EDA of this notebook can be done in SQL rather than just Pandas and for the author's (Jacob Zimmerman's) learning purposes. It is **NOT** the full notebook. Most code that was unnecessary to completing the SQL versions of EDA tasks has been ommitted. The full notebook, containing modeling, extensive analyses, and detailed visualizations, is located [here](https://github.com/jakezimm12/Open-Food-Facts-EDA-and-Nutritional-Value-Modeling). Note, I do not use SQL to redo every EDA operation or to redo any of the cleaning because it was oftentimes quite simple. To just see the SQL, skip the 'Cleaning the Data' section and scroll to the 'EDA' section of the notebook (or click the link in the table of contents on the left in Collab).
